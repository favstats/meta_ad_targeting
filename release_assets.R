#' Parse the asset table of a GitHub release "expanded_assets" page
#'
#' Reads the filename, size and upload timestamp out of the DOM rather than out
#' of fixed line offsets in the row text. GitHub added a sha256 digest line to
#' these rows at the end of August 2026, which shifted the offsets this code
#' used to rely on (filename `x[3]`, size `x[6]`, timestamp `x[7]`). The parse
#' then silently produced empty filenames instead of failing, so every scraper
#' that looks up "the latest release asset" quietly stopped finding one.
#'
#' @param html_content A parsed HTML document, e.g. `httr::content(response)`.
#' @return A tibble with `filename`, `file_size` and `timestamp`. Rows that are
#'   not downloadable assets (the two "Source code" entries) get an `NA`
#'   filename, and are dropped by the callers' `filter(filename != ...)`.
